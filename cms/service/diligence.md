**Check the boxes, get taken seriously.**

### Compliance & Security Auditing

We first complete our own compliance & security audits of your project, which are guided by years of completing similar audits with our partners, learning the methodologies and tools used, and learning how to correct issues before they arise in an audit. Following our in-house audit and correction of any issues we've found, we guide you through an audit with CertiK with intent to get you a score in the top 10% of ranked projects. This accomplishment proves to your community and stakeholders that your project is secure and safe for users and investors.

### Scoring

Next, we broaden our in-house auditing to address additional factors in project safety, such as feasibility of roadmap and technology, team, community, and more, using industry-standard methodologies and tools. After correcting any issues, we guide you through a ranking audit with TokenInsight with the aim of achieving a minimum CCC rating. This accomplishment proves to potential investors that your project is safe for investment and shows long-term growth potential.

### Listing

Finally, having worked with many due diligence agents from various exchanges, we proactively address any remaining concerns before guiding your project through one or several listings as appropriate on prominent exchanges with high liquidity and solid reputations. We ensure that this is done strategically with the correct timing a combination of exchanges to maximize the outcome and eliminate the risk of creating arbitrage opportunities on your token between multiple exchanges.
