**Get your one-way decisions right the first time, because there is no second time.**

### Tokenomics

Our team of Web3 expert entrepreneurs, investors, and traders have dissected and concocted hundreds of token economies. We study closely the case studies of token economies and governance models making or breaking projects. Let our team guide you to the correct decisions on circulation, emission, vesting schedules, etc.

### Governance

No project succeeds without the support of a vibrant community and stakeholders including active wallet users, stakers, validators, investors, and more. Generating the adoption and engagement you need requires giving just the right amount of control to your token holders. Our team helps you identify the Goldilocks' zone, or sets you up to embrace becoming a full-on DAO.

### Roadmap

Anyone can say they're going to add a ZK rollup in a week, but missed roadmap targets are noticed by all, and once your community and stakeholders see that you can't keep your word, all trust with your project is lost. Our team helps you to build a roadmap that features meaningful accomplishments aligned with your project and current Web3 narratives, while also ensuring that they are timed to be achievable.
