  In Web3, community is the new moat. Without a vibrant community full of
  passionate supports who genuinely believe in your project, your Web3 project
  is simply doomed to fail, even if everything else is done right—this is just
  the nature of the Web3 world.


  There is no shortcut to growing an effective community. Paying influencers,
  running ads, buying followers, or using bots are all excellent ways to
  permanently blacklist your project and every other project you ever work on.
  Due diligence agents are used by every exchange and every sophisticated
  investor, all of whom know how to use simple and publicly available tools that
  will expose fake metrics such as fake followers, fake trading volume, etc.


  In order to demonstrate to these due diligence agents that your project is not
  a scam, we help you do the following:


  *   Identify and remove all existing fake followers (bots, fake accounts,
  etc.)

  *   Identify and eliminate any fake trading volume and arbitrage

  *   Change your primary community to Discord if it is not already Discord—no
  serious projects operate on Telegram anymore

  *   Create an organic community growth strategy

  *   Help you build a vibrant, passionate, and loyal community of real, raving
  supporters, the right way


  Please note that none of these steps are optional. If you're not willing to
  complete all of our certifications and implement all of our recommendations,
  then we won't work with you.

### Brand, Narrative, & Messaging

Our team of Web3 natives and fellow entrepreneurs stay immersed in the latest Web3 trends and chatter using a combination of software tools and direct community involvement. We assess your project against this knowledge with a rigorous evaluation process to determine if your project is what the market is looking for, and then laser-focus your messaging to resonate with your community and with potential stakeholders.

### Compliance, Auditing, Scoring, & Listing

We leverage long and tight partnerships with CoinMarketCap, CertiK, TokenInsight, and other key partners to help you achieve verified ratings that indicate to investors and exchanges that your project is a low-risk high-reward opportunity. We then leverage our connections with leading exchanges to get you listed where it counts and avoid accidental arbitrage situations that arise from unknowing companies listing on too many exchanges.

### Tokenomics, Governance, Framework, & Roadmap

We consult and guide you on the most important but often least well understood aspects of your Web3 economy—one-way irreversible decisions about your company's economy that can and have destroyed unicorn projects many times. We help fix any errors made to date, then arrange your new tokenomics and roadmap into explanatory materials that communicate the key items for which sophisticated investors and exchange due diligence agents are looking.

### Investment

Finally, we leverage our network of Web3 investors, with whom we co-invest in your project, bringing you the capital you need to realize the rest of your roadmap.
