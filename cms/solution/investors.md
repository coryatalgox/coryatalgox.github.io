  As an investor seeking opportunities to grow your capital quickly, you see the
  unparalleled opportunities offered by the Web3 industry, as well as the risks
  and challenges—how does one identify the real projects amongst the sea of
  scams? At AlgoX, we leverage a bespoke proven and ever-updating methodology
  that combines our own Web3 entrepreneurial and investment experience with a
  network of partnerships in Web3 auditing, compliance, and safety scoring.

  Don't take our word for it. When we curate investment projects, we present
  them with not only our assessment and guidance, but also a CertiK compliance &
  security score, a TokenInsight investment safety rating, a CoinMarketCap
  listing, and typically 1-2 prominent exchange listings. On top of that, we
  co-invest with you, so we have skin in the game too. Projects that fail or
  refuse to complete all of our evaluations & partner evaluations, fall below
  our minimum scores, and/or fail to implement all of our recommendations are
  not considered by our investment-accelerator program and not presented to you.

  In Web3, community is the new moat. Without a vibrant community full of
  passionate supports who genuinely believe in a project, the project is simply
  doomed to fail, even if everything else is done right—this is just the nature
  of the Web3 world.


  There is no shortcut to growing an effective community. Paying influencers,
  running ads, buying followers, or using bots are all excellent ways to
  permanently blacklist a project and its directors. We leverage a due diligence
  toolkit that exposes fake metrics such as fake followers, fake trading volume,
  etc.


  In order to reduce risk and increase transparency, we force all projects we
  work with to do the following with our guidance:


  *   Identify and remove all existing fake followers (bots, fake accounts,
  etc.)

  *   Identify and eliminate any fake trading volume and arbitrage

  *   Change the primary community to Discord if it is not already Discord—no
  serious projects operate on Telegram anymore

  *   Create an organic community growth strategy

  *   Build a vibrant, passionate, and loyal community of real, raving
  supporters, the right way


  None of these steps are optional. Projects that are not willing to complete
  all of our certifications and implement all of our recommendations are not
  considered by our investment-accelerator fund and are not presented to you.
  Projects we do present to you will always be accompanied by proof of
  satisfactory completion of all of these steps.

### Brand, Narrative, & Messaging

Our team of Web3 natives and fellow entrepreneurs stay immersed in the latest Web3 trends and chatter using a combination of software tools and direct community involvement. We assess projects against this knowledge with a rigorous evaluation process to determine if a given project is what the market is looking for, and then laser-focus their messaging to resonate with their community.

### Compliance, Auditing, Scoring, & Listing

We leverage long and tight partnerships with CoinMarketCap, CertiK, TokenInsight, and other key partners to help projects achieve verified ratings that indicate a low-risk high-reward opportunity. We then leverage our connections with leading exchanges to get them listed where it counts and avoid accidental arbitrage situations that arise from unknowing companies listing on too many exchanges.

### Tokenomics, Governance, Framework, & Roadmap

We consult and guide projects on the most important but often least well understood aspects of their Web3 economy—one-way irreversible decisions about their company's economy that can and have destroyed unicorn projects many times. We help fix any errors made to date, then arrange the revised tokenomics and roadmap into explanatory materials that communicate the key items you're looking for as a sophisticated investor.

### Investment

Finally, we co-invest with you on the project, either with you as a single investor or with multiple investment partners depending on what we gauge is the most appropriate for that particular project. We always have skin in the game with every project.
